### Hi! üëã‚Äç

### About me 
I am a data scientist with 4+ years of research experience in clinical psychology 
and rigorous training in statistical analysis from graduate school.
With my research work and studies in statistics and data analysis, 
it naturally led me interested in and became passionated 
about pursuing data science. 

To delve into data science and machine learning, 
I recently completed [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/) 
that helped me brush my skills in statistical analysis, 
data visualization, machine learning algorithms, 
and data engineering.
